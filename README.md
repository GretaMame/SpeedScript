# SpeedScript
A script I wrote for my mom that copies data from excel and pastes it to www.etpbonomi.it website and submits the data. 

<b>Preconditions:</b>
1. You have to be logged in the website.
2. Have data ready in your excel file (Column A is for  part numbers and column B is for the amount of the corresponding part)
  file name: pozicijos.xlsx (you can change it in the script file)

<b>To run the script:</b>
1. Double click on the script file
2. Press ctrl+j

<b>Important!</b> While the script is running don't perform any unecessary actions on the computer. The rule saying 'Look but don't touch' applies here. Go make yourself a coffee and hope for the best :)

If for any reason the script is not performing as expected you can terminate it by pressing the escape button.
